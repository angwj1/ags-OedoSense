Description
--------
**``AGS OedoSense``** is an open-source application developed in Python 3 and packaged into an executable via PyInstaller to: 
- Read oedometer test data in MS excel files (in AGS format)
- Check data format 
- Plot oedometer test data
- Calculate the preconsolidation pressure with three methods: 
  1. Casagrande's method (1936) 
  2. Oikawa's method (1987) 
  3. Maximum Curvature method (Gregory et al., 2006) 
- Compare the calculated preconsolidation pressure against the recorded preconsolidation pressure (in AGS)

Instructions
--------
Instructions to use application (please refer to the step-by-step guide for more details):
1. Double-click the "AGS OedoSense".exe
2. Select the input folder containing the MS excel files (in AGS format)
3. Select the output folder that will store the results generated by the application 
4. Adjust the settings as necessary 
5. Check the data format
6. Generate graphs and calculate preconsolidation pressure
